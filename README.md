# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website that is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://brendonlapp.github.io/). This project was built to expand upon my knowledge of React as well as to create a place for me to display the different projects I have worked on.

## Tech Used

- React JS
- JavaScript
- Firebase
- EmailJS
- Bootstrap
- GitHub Pages

## To Run the Project

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run deploy`

Deploys the application to Github Pages
