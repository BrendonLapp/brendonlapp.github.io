            Hi, Iâ€™m Brendon Lapp and I am a Software Developer at LawDepot where
            I have been working since October 2021. While at LawDepot I have
            been working with C#, Microsoft SQL, TypeScript, and Vue JS to
            create internal tools and maintain the live website. I have excelled
            at working with these technologies and expanding upon my knowledge
            in the software development world. Previously, I have worked at Neo
            Financial where I used MongoDB, TypeScript, and React JS to create
            internal tools for the developers to use. At NAIT I learned the
            foundations for software development with C#, Microsoft SQL and the
            development for websites and the mobile world. I hope that you take
            interest in some of the projects I have worked on in my{' '}
