            Hi, I’m Brendon Lapp and I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in the
            BAIST program in the Information Systems major at NAIT. I also
            possess a diploma from the DMIT program specializing in computer
            software development. In these programs, I have honed my skills at
            building software in the Microsoft technology stack and on mobile
            platforms.I have been gained valuable experience at Neo Financial
            where I have improved my skills at working with TypeScript, MongoDB,
            and React. In the future, I want to continue to expand my skillset
            and continue to drive myself forward and take on new challenges and
            learn new technology and languages. I know I am someone that has
            what it takes to be a strong asset at your company and hope you may
            consider me for an internship opportunity where I am available
            starting in September this year.
