            Hi, I’m Brendon Lapp and I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in the
            BAIST program in the Information Systems major at NAIT. I also
            possess a diploma from the DMIT program specializing in computer
            software development. In these programs, I have honed my skills at
            building software in the Microsoft technology stack and on mobile
            platforms. I have been gained valuable experience at Neo Financial
            where I have improved my skills at working with TypeScript, MongoDB,
            and React. In the future, I want to continue to expand my skillset
            and take on new challenges. I know I am someone that has what it
            takes to be a valuable teamplayer and create quality software. I
            hope you take interst in some of the projects I have worked on
            previously.
